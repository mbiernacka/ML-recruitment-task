# ML-recruitment-task

Repository contains solved task during recruitment for Machine Learning position. It consists of:
- loading dataset
- creating simple heuristic
- creating ML models: Decision Tree and Random Forest
- function finding best hyperparameters for Neural Network 
- evaluation of models, basic metrics (accuracy, f1, precision, recall)
- script creating simple REST API

Script is divided into modules.
main -> Heuristic -> Models -> NN -> Evaluation -> API

Running every module runs all previous modules up to that one. (So to run the entire script run module API).
